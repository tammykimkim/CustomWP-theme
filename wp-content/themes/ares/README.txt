Ares Responsive WordPress Theme
====================================================

Notes to users:

* When you first install the theme on a new WordPress site, WordPress usually adds default widgets to the Header Right widget placeholder, which may break the functionality of the menu.
To fix this issue, please go to Appearance - Widgets, and remove the default widgets( usually search, meta etc..) from the Header Right placeholder
* Due to the limited space, the site title will get cut off if it's too long
* If you upload a logo, that will replace the title
* Go to Appearance - Theme Options to customize the look of the site by choosing which options you want
